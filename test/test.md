# Test Cases (should be written as a program eventually)

## Cases that work without pre-built wallets. 

* respond to a shutdown request. 
* fail to generate a random key.
* initialize random number generator.
* succeed at generating a random key once the random number generator has been initialized.
  * Different kinds of keys
* add public keys to the database and successfully retrieve private keys
* add addresses to the database and successfully retrieve public keys
* make a wallet.
* Add key sequence to wallet
* generate next keys of key sequences. 
* generate different types of wallets.

## For the next case we need a pre-built wallet.
